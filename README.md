_I've always had a passion for knowledge and a drive to improve things and help others. I see technology as a powerful tool for learning and creativity. It has consistently helped me understand the world better and find solutions to various problems._

_It's fascinating to witness the rapid advancements in technology, which is why I decided to learn programming languages. Currently, I'm a junior web developer seeking job opportunities. However, my goals extend beyond just finding a job; I want to collaborate with others and continuously learn about people and new technologies._

_I've created a [portfolio](https://portafolio-three-black.vercel.app/) to showcase my skills and experience. Additionally, you can explore other projects I've worked on by checking my [repositories](https://github.com/Jhoan5?tab=repositories)._
